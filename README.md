# Sysmon Configurations
This module is used by the Sysmon XML to ILF translator and the Sysmon to Logstash translator.

It allows for the configuration of:
* Allowed Sysmon events
* Allowed fields in a Sysmon event
* Sysmon field mappings to ECS
* Sysmon event names

## Configuration Files

There are 3 separate configuration files, all of these files are located in their own directories, see the [directory structure](./README.md#directory-structure) for more details. You can add custom configuration files by adding the new json file to the correct directory.

To aid in the construction of configuration files, a template csv, and [configuration generator script](#config-generation) are provided.

By default, the configuration will contain mappings for all Sysmon events/fields, and allow all fields for Sysmon v15.0.

### Allowed Fields Config

A json file that contains mappings from Sysmon-event ID to an array of allowed Sysmon fields.

Allowed fields configuration files should be placed in the `/allowed-field-configs` directory

See the [directory structure](./README.md#directory-structure) for more details.

Any fields that are not listed under an event will not be included in the output event.

*All events **must** contain an entry in the allowed fields config file. If one does not exist, the event will be **dropped** in the logstash pipeline.*

#### Allowed Fields Config Example

If we wanted to allow only the `UtcTime` and `ProcessId` Sysmon fields in event id `1`, `ProcessCreate`:

```json
{
  "1": [
    "UtcTime",
    "ProcessId"
  ],
  "2": [
    <Other field mappings here>
  ],
  <More event mappings here>
}
```

### Field Mappings Config

A json file that contains mappings from Sysmon-event ID to a json object containing key value pairs of Sysmon fields → ECS fields.

Field mappings configuration files should be placed in the `/field-mappings-configs` directory

See the [directory structure](./README.md#directory-structure) for more details.

*All events **must** contain at least one entry in the field mappings config file. If one does not exist, the translator using the configuration files will default to **dropping** the event.*

*Any fields that **do not** contain a mapping in the configuration file will be **dropped** from the event. If there are no valid ECS fields associated with the Sysmon field, map the field to `winlogbeat.event_data.[FIELD_NAME]`.*

#### Field Mapping Config Example

If we wanted to map only the `UtcTime` and `ProcessId` Sysmon fields in event id `1`, `ProcessCreate` to ECS fields:

```json
{
  "1": {
    "UtcTime": "@timestamp",
    "ProcessId": "process.pid"
  },
  "2": {
    <Other field mappings here>
  },
  <More event mappings here>
}
```

### Event Names Config

A json file that contains mappings from Sysmon-event ID to an event name. This name is used when generating the ILF associated with a Sysmon event.

Event name configuration files should be placed in the `/name-mappings-configs` directory

See the [directory structure](./README.md#directory-structure) for more details.

*Events that do **not** contain an entry in the event names config file, will be provided the default name of `NoMatchingEventName`. It is highly recommended to include a name mapping for all events*

#### Event Names Config Example

If we wanted to map the ILF event name of event id `1`, `ProcessCreate` to `CreateProcessEvent`:

```json
{
  "1": "CreateProcessEvent",
  "2": <Other ILF name>,
  <More event mappings here>
}
```

### Configuration Files Output Example

Here is an example output when using the configurations from the 3 configuration files listed above with the [sysmon_to_ilf logstash translator](https://gitlab.mitre.org/seal/translators/sysmon_to_ilf).

#### Input

```json
{
    "winlog": {
        "process": {
            "pid": "45652"
        },
        "event_data": {
            "UtcTime": "2023-06-16 17:14:35.713",
            "ProcessGuid": "{d2a7e984-987b}",
            "ParentProcessGuid": "{d2a7e984-64b6}",
            "User": "MITRE\\CSCOPETSKI",
            "ProcessId": "8892"
        },
    },
    "event": {
        "code": "1",
        "action": "Process accessed (rule: ProcessAccess)"
    }
}
```

#### Output

```json
{
    "@timestamp":"2023-06-16T17:14:35.713Z",
    "process": {
      "pid": "8892"
    },
    "event": {
        "code": "1"
    },
    "ilf_string":"CreateProcessEvent[*,*,2023-06-16T17:14:35.713Z,(process__pid=8892,event__code=1)]"
}
```

Based on our example configs, only the `UtcTime` and `ProcessId` fields are allowed.

`UtcTime` is mapped to `@timestamp` and `ProcessId` is mapped to `process.pid`.

Every event will contain an `event.code` which is equal to the Sysmon event ID.

We can see that our ILF name "`CreateProcessEvent`" from the config was utilized in the `ilf_string`, which also contains the `@timestamp`, `process__pid`, and `event_code` fields.

### Config Generation

To help with customizing the [allowed fields](#allowed-fields-config) and [field mappings](#field-mappings-config) config files, a template CSV and generation script are provided.

#### CSV

The CSV consists of four columns

| Column Name       | Description                                                                                                                   | Valid Values        |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| `EventId`         | The Sysmon event ID associated with the row                                                                                   | Any Sysmon Event ID |
| `SysmonFieldName` | The Sysmon field we are mapping from                                                                                          | Any Sysmon Field    |
| `ECSFieldName`    | The Elastic Common Schema field we are mapping to. In [special cases](#multivalue-mapping), we may map to multiple ECS fields | Any ECS Field       |
| `IsAllowed`       | Whether we want to allow this event field, or to filter it out in the logstash pipeline                                | TRUE or FALSE       |

The provided base csv `sysmon_ecs_event_mappings_config.csv` contains mappings for all events included in `Sysmon v15.0` (1-29 & 255).

For details on where it is located see the [directory structure](./README.md#directory-structure).

##### Multivalue Mapping

There are some Sysmon fields, that do not map properly to a single ECS field. These fields must be mapped to multiple ECS fields.

To map multiple values simply separate the ECS fields with commas, and surround them in quotes `""`

For example:

```csv
EventId,SysmonFieldName,ECSFieldName,IsAllowed
1,User,"user.domain,user.name",TRUE
1,Hashes,"process.hash.md5,process.hash.sha1,process.hash.sha256,process.pe.imphash",TRUE
```

The two currently supported multivalue mappings are for `User` and `Hashes`. Additional multivalue mappings will need to be programmed as special cases into all translators that use the configuration files.

For details on how the filtering of multivalue fields works in the sysmon_to_ilf logstash translator, see the [ruby filter](https://gitlab.mitre.org/seal/translators/sysmon_to_ilf/-/blob/main/Developer.md?ref_type=heads#multi-value-field-mapping).

#### Script

The config generator script is `generator.py`. For details on where it is located see the [directory structure](./README.md#directory-structure).

```text
usage: Sysmon-ILF Config Parser [-h] [-i INPUT] [-m MAPPING] [-a ALLOWED]

Converts sysmon-ecs mapping csv file into configuration files required for sysmon-ilf logstash module

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT, --input INPUT
                        name of the csv to be parsed (must be a csv file)
  -m MAPPING, --mappings MAPPING
                        name of the field mappings output file (must end in .json)
  -a ALLOWED, --allowed ALLOWED
                        name of the allowed fields output file (must end in .json)
```

The generator script looks for the default `sysmon_ecs_event_mappings_config.csv` in its directory as an input, and will by default output the two json configs `field_mappings.json` and `allowed_fields.json`.

Using the command line arguments you can change the names of the input/output files and the directories to look in

*The input file **must** be a CSV, and must follow the same [schema](#csv) as the default config csv*
